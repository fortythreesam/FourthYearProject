## Abstract

Estimating noise level from a single image contaminated by additive zero-mean gaussian noise. First provide rigorous analysis on the statistical relationship between the noise variance and  the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of patches within an image, which shows that many state-of-the-art noise estimation methods underestimate the noise level of an image. We derive a nonparametric algorithm for efficient noise level estimation based on the observation that patches decomposed from a clean image often lie around a low dimensional subspace. 

- Zero mean gaussian noise: the noise does not present a net disturbance to the system.
