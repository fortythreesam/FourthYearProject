## Abstract

Shows how to estimate an upper bound on the noise level from a single image based on a piecewise smooth image prior model and measured CCD camera response function. Also learn the space of noise level functions - how noise level changes with respect to brightness- and use bayesian MAP inference to infer the noise level function from a single image.

- Piecewise-defined funciton : a function which is defined by multiple sub functions, each sub-function      applying to a certain interval. 
- Piecewise smooth function: a piecewise funciton that can be broken into distinct pieces and on each piece both the funcitons and their derivatives, are continuous.
- CCD (charge coupled device): a highly sensitive photon detector.
- Bayesian inference: a method of statistical inference in which Bayes'theorem is used to update the probability as more evidence or info becomes available
- Bayes'theorem: describes the probability of an event, based on prioir knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event
- MAP (maximum a posteriori estimation): an estimate of an unknown quantity, that equals the mode of the posterior distribution
- Posterior probability: the posterior probability of a random event or an uncertain proposition is the conditional probability that is assigned after the relevant evidence or background is taken into account
- Posterior probability distribution: the probability distribution of an unknown quantity, treated as a random variable, conditional on the evidence obtained from an experiment or study.
