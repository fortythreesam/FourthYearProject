## Abstract
Bilateral filter method is a nonlinear filter with spatial averageing without smoothing edges. Denoising performance using the bilateral filter is affected by the filter parameters, which are image dependent and require experimental trials. They propose an automatic and effective PSO-based method of parameter selection for the bilateral filter. Intensity domain parameter &delta;r and the radius parameter d are optimised by the PSO algorithm, in which SSIM (structurally similarity index) is employed in the fitness function.
